# CDAC-PROJECT
 Formulating a Methodology for Conducting VAPT on IoT Devices and Networks
 Platform : Nmap, Hydra,Wireshark, Kali Linux, MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, Zigbee, other protocols
 The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive methodology for conducting Vulnerability
 Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on IoT devices and networks. The approach integrates various
 testing techniques, tools, and procedures to identify vulnerabilities, simulate real-world attack scenarios, and
 strengthen the security of IoT systems. The methodology will encompass an in-depth study of the IoT
 ecosystem, including devices, applications, and communication protocols. The final deliverable will be a
 structured framework for performing VAPT on IoT environments, aimed at enforcing robust security policies
 and measures
